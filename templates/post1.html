        Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes
        place
        in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a
        customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and
        ranged
        combat.</p>

    <p>The game was developed using the REDengine 4 by a team of around 500 people, exceeding the number that worked on
        the
        studio's previous game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015). CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland,
        and
        partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike
        Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves has a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin
        Przybyłowicz, featuring the contributions of several licensed artists.</p>

    <p>CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, with
        PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions planned to follow in 2021. It received praise for its narrative,
        setting,
        and graphics, although some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses. In contrast, it was widely
        criticized
        for bugs, particularly in the console versions which also suffered from performance issues; Sony removed it from
        the
        PlayStation Store on 17 December 2020.</p>
